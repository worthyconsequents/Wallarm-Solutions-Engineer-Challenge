# Wallarm Solutions Engineer Technical Evaluation Solution

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Welcome to the **Wallarm Solutions Engineer Technical Evaluation**. This exercise is designed to assess your ability to deploy and configure Wallarm's filtering nodes using a deployment method of your choice, troubleshoot any issues encountered, and document your process effectively. Additionally, we will evaluate your ability to leverage our official documentation to complete the task.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

By the end of this evaluation, you should be able to:

âœ… Deploy a Wallarm filtering node using a supported method of your choice.  
âœ… Configure a backend origin to receive test traffic. (httpbin.org is also acceptable)  
âœ… Use the **GoTestWAF** attack simulation tool to generate traffic.  
âœ… Document the deployment and troubleshooting process.  
âœ… Demonstrate proficiency in using **Wallarm's official documentation**.

## Architecture Overview
I chose the route to have wallarm act as a reverse proxy to a small web application hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Wallarm Edge Deployment

Step 1: Accessing to the Wallarm UI
I went into the email sent from Wallarm SE to get access to the console (https://**.audit.****.com) and followed the steps to get my console up and running

Step 2: Setup Edge deployment
I followed the instructions to ensure my traffic was routed via DNS to Wallarm (https://docs.wallarm.com/installation/security-edge/inline/overview/)

## Wallarm GoTestWAF
Reqs: Docker Installed on workstation

Step1: Run GoTestWAF
docker run --rm --network="host" -it -v ${PWD}/reports:/app/reports \
    wallarm/gotestwaf --url=http://example.com

Step2: Confirm Attacks were filtered by Wallarm console

## Notes
Encountered the no WAF detected error, but was solved I was limiting traffic to the EC2 instance

Originally, I wanted to deploy this natively via docker image, but I was unsuccessful in having the Node properly register to the Wallarm console. I checked the API tokens/Node tokens and was not able to resolve this. I checked yaml files and logs to see if I could resolve, but was stuck on the acl folder path.

## Closing Thoughts
It was very fun to deploy a filtering Node. It was fun to run the GoTestWAF tool and see the attacks coming into the application.
